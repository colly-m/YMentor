The HuMentor project idea came up to enable ease in connection between mentors and people 
who may need there expertice in particular fields and not necessarily turn to AI and maybe 
get first hand infomation from a person who has been able to tackle the same, I mean get 
the human point of view.
We all know how fulfiling it is to help someone so that is the same idea that came to mind
while creating this application to be able to connect poeple, who are in similar fields and
are at diffent levels and helping each other grow.

For the front end I choose to use HTML, Javascript and CSS3. I did not include other 
frameworks to it but alittle bootstrap was added to the html. The main point was to actual 
build on the concepts I had learnt and try to perfect it. I used python flask for the 
backend and mysql for the database but I am also experimenting with graphql for the database 
schema I understand t is best suitable for precise collecting of data. I'm also trying to
make it work for the mobile to enable seemless interactions on the mobile.
I had difficulty in trying to connect my databases to the application and actually getting 
the correct result so I did alot of experimentation to arrive at what actually suit the 
application. I tried using wtforms to create the login and signup authenticators which I 
learnt through youtube but for some reason it was quite a challenge so I sort to just create 
the files with html and css styles which worked as I expected.
It is imporntant to choose a language you are familiar with and also it is best to also 
have a bit of understanding of other languages that can be used to achieve the same goal 
or even make the application be more efficient.
I have learnt that I need to be more open minded while tackling issues that appartain to 
developing by being willing to learn new stuff each day. Being ready to ask for assistance to 
someone who has handled or been in the same situation, which is also the reason for the project.
I can confirm that with the right tools and language of expertise it is possible to come 
up with an awesome project.
